    * `id_parent` The OPSkins ID of the item you purchased which created this item. For example, if you bought item #12345 and ended up with item #23456 in your OPSkins inventory, then `id` will be 23456 and `id_parent` will be 12345.

##<a name='Deposit'>Deposit(`string` items)</a>

Add between 1 and 50 items (upper cap subject to change) to your On-Site Inventory. This will fail if any of the items passed in already have sales with active trade offers out. If there's a matching sale for an item that doesn't have a trade offer out, it will automatically be deleted. This works identically to ISales/ListItems/v1 minus the price and addons parameters.

 * `items` A JSON-encoded array of objects. One object for each item you wish to list. Each object should contain these properties:
    * `appid` The Steam AppID of the game which owns this item (e.g. 730 for CS:GO, 440 for TF2, 570 for Dota 2)
    * `contextid` The Steam context ID which contains this item (2 for Valve games, 6 for Steam Community items, 1 for H1Z1, etc.). When you right-click on an item in your Steam inventory and copy its URL, the context ID is the second number after the hash.
    * `assetid` The Steam asset ID of the item. This is also known as just the item's id
 
Output:

 * `tradeoffer_id` If a trade offer was successfully sent, this is its ID as a string. If we weren't able to send a trade offer, this is `null`

 * `security_token` The 6-character security token that is included in the trade offer message.
 * `sales` An array containing objects describing the sales that were created. Each object has these properties:
     * `saleid` The OPSkins internal ID of this sale
     * `appid` The Steam AppID for this item
     * `contextid` The Steam context ID in which this item resides in your inventory
     * `assetid` The current asset ID of this item in your inventory
     * `market_name` The name of this item
     * `price` The list price of this item in USD cents (typically set to $99,999.99)

##<a name='pricing-methods'>Pricing</a>

!! These methods are used accessing the 'Pricing' property !!

Example:

    OPSkins.Pricing.GetPriceList(730).then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    });
    
##<a name='GetPriceList'>GetPriceList(`int` appid)</a>

 * `appid` The Steam application ID of the app you want prices for. For example, 730 for CS:GO, 440 for TF2, or 753 for Steam.
 
Output:

`response` is an object whose keys are item names. Values of those keys are objects whose keys are dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, and the value of those keys are objects which contain several properties describing the item's sale price on that day. Prices are in USD cents (formerly known as OP). The properties are:

 * mean
 * min
 * max
 * normalized_mean
 * normalized_min
 * normalized_max
 * std_dev

The output of this method is cached by OPSkins' CDN. Therefore, the timestamp is most likely not going to be accurate. This list updates nightly at or around midnight server time (Eastern United States timezone).

##<a name='GetAllLowestListPrices'>GetAllLowestListPrices(`int` appid)</a>

 * `appid` The Steam application ID of the app you want prices for. For example, 730 for CS:GO, 440 for TF2, or 753 for Steam.

`response` is an object whose keys are item names. Values of those keys are objects which have the following keys:

   * `price` The lowest available list price for that item, in USD cents
   * `quantity` The total amount of that item we have on sale, for any price
   
The proper way to interpret an entry is "quantity currently on sale, starting at price".

##<a name='sales-methods'>Sales</a>

!! These methods are used accessing the 'Sales' property !!

Example:

    OPSkins.Sales.GetSales({type: 2, appid: 730).then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    });
    
##<a name='GetSales'>GetSales(`object` options)</a>

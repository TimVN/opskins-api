## <a name='Deposit'>Deposit(`string` items)</a>

Add between 1 and 50 items (upper cap subject to change) to your On-Site Inventory. This will fail if any of the items passed in already have sales with active trade offers out. If there's a matching sale for an item that doesn't have a trade offer out, it will automatically be deleted. This works identically to ISales/ListItems/v1 minus the price and addons parameters.

Input:

 * `items` A JSON-encoded array of objects. One object for each item you wish to list. Each object should contain these properties:
    * `appid` The Steam AppID of the game which owns this item (e.g. 730 for CS:GO, 440 for TF2, 570 for Dota 2)
    * `contextid` The Steam context ID which contains this item (2 for Valve games, 6 for Steam Community items, 1 for H1Z1, etc.). When you right-click on an item in your Steam inventory and copy its URL, the context ID is the second number after the hash.

 * `security_token` The 6-character security token that is included in the trade offer message.
 * `sales` An array containing objects describing the sales that were created. Each object has these properties:
     * `saleid` The OPSkins internal ID of this sale
     * `appid` The Steam AppID for this item
     * `contextid` The Steam context ID in which this item resides in your inventory
     * `assetid` The current asset ID of this item in your inventory

# <a name='pricing-methods'>Pricing</a>

!! These methods are used accessing the 'Pricing' property !!

    });
    
## <a name='GetPriceList'>GetPriceList(`int` appid)</a>

Input:

 * `appid` The Steam application ID of the app you want prices for. For example, 730 for CS:GO, 440 for TF2, or 753 for Steam.
 
Output:

`response` is an object whose keys are item names. Values of those keys are objects whose keys are dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, and the value of those keys are objects which contain several properties describing the item's sale price on that day. Prices are in USD cents (formerly known as OP). The properties are:

 * mean
 * min
 * max
 * normalized_mean
 * normalized_min
 * normalized_max
 * std_dev

The output of this method is cached by OPSkins' CDN. Therefore, the timestamp is most likely not going to be accurate. This list updates nightly at or around midnight server time (Eastern United States timezone).

## <a name='GetAllLowestListPrices'>GetAllLowestListPrices(`int` appid)</a>

Input:

 * `appid` The Steam application ID of the app you want prices for. For example, 730 for CS:GO, 440 for TF2, or 753 for Steam.

   * `price` The lowest available list price for that item, in USD cents
   * `quantity` The total amount of that item we have on sale, for any price
   
The proper way to interpret an entry is "quantity currently on sale, starting at price".

Example:

    OPSkins.Sales.GetSales({type: 2, appid: 730).then(data => {

## <a name='EditPriceMulti'>EditPriceMulti(`object` items)</a>

Queue price updates for up to 500 items. On success, this method will return an HTTP 202 Accepted status code and will respond immediately. The actual price updates will be queued and will be processed in the background. This will fail if you attempt to queue a price update for an item which already has a queued price update. Price update errors will not be reported and will be silently dropped in the background. For example, requests to edit the prices of items you do not own or which do not exist will be accepted, but will not actually be processed.

Input:

 * `items` And object where the keys are the OPSkins sale IDs and the values are new prices in USD cents.

## <a name='BumpItems'>BumpItems(`array` items)</a>

Bump one or more items you've listed for sale to the top of the browse page and the featured (default) sort for search. Will cost $0.50 per item, but will use any free bump credits you may have (e.g. from a premium membership) first.

It is possible for bumping to fail for some items in this batch and to succeed for others.

## <a name='ReturnItems'>ReturnItems(`array` items)</a>

Return one or more items you've listed for sale to your Steam accounts. Input items must be either on sale or awaiting return, and must not have an active trade offer out or queued. Under most circumstances, a trade offer won't be queued, but it's possible if, for example, you request that an item be returned and the bot is offline at the time of request.

This will (attempt to) send trade offers for all items in your input. If multiple trade offers must be sent, they will be sent in series. Therefore, you may wish to call this method separately for each bot that will be sending an offer (you can use GetSales to find out which bot is holding which item).

If the `status` is not OK (1), the output will still be defined (if your input was well-formed, there were no unexpected internal errors, and Steam is not completely down) in the event that the failure was due to Steam (e.g. bad trade URL, item doesn't exist anymore, trade server down).

Input:

 * `items` An array of sale IDs of items you want returned
 
Output:

 * `offers` An array of objects, where each object in this array represents one trade offer that we sent (or tried to send)
 * `bot_id` The internal ID of the bot that sent (or tried to send) this trade offer
 * `items` An array of sale IDs which were in this offer
 * `tradeoffer_id` If the offer was successfully sent, this is its trade offer ID as a string. `null` on failure
 * `tradeoffer_error` If the offer couldn't be sent, this is an error message. `null` on success

## <a name='GetActiveTradeOffers'>GetActiveTradeOffers()</a>

Get the list of active trade offers which our bots have sent you.

Output:

 * `offers` An object whose keys are Steam trade offer IDs, and values are objects each with this structure:
     * `saleids` An array containing the OPSkins sale IDs of the items in this offer
     * `bot_id` The internal OPSkins ID of the bot which sent this trade
     * `bot_id64` The 64-bit SteamID of the bot which sent this trade
     * `type` A string, which may be one of pickup, return, or withdrawal
     
## <a name='Search'>Search(`string` app, *optional* `string` search_item, *optional* `float` min, *optional* `float` max )</a>
     
Search active OPSkins listings for particular items. This endpoint is relatively heavily rate-limited. Currently, it is limited to 20 requests per minute. To prevent bot sniping, this endpoint will only return listings which have been publicly visible for at least ten minutes, and are not currently limited to Buyers Club members. This endpoint always returns 100 listings sorted from lowest to highest price.

Input is identical to that of the main site's search page. The most important parameters are listed here.

 * `app` Required. This is the appid_contextid pair for the app you wish to search. For example, use `730_2` to search CS:GO listings.
 * `search_item` Optional. This is the search term which will be matched to item names. This uses fuzzy matching by default. Wrap your term in quotes to only return exact matches. For example, to find items containing the exact string "case key" (case-insensitive), then this value should be `"case key"`.
 * `min` Optional. The minimum item price to return, in USD. Note that this is different from most other currency displays which use USD cents. For example, pass `0.5` here to only search for items priced at $0.50 and up.
 * `max` Optional. The maximum item price to return, in USD.
 
Output:
 
 * `sales` An array of objects containing the results of your search query. Each object has these properties:
     * `id` The item's OPSkins sale ID
     * `amount` The item's list price, in USD cents
     * `classid` The item's Steam classid at time of pickup (may have changed in trade)
     * `instanceid` The item's Steam instanceid at time of pickup (may have changed in trade)
     * `img` The item's Steam image URL (append this to https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/image/)
     * `market_name` The item's name
     * `inspect` The full URL to inspect this item, if applicable. If not, then this is null
     * `type` The item's "type" as reported by Steam (e.g. Base Grade Key)
     * `item_id` The item's Steam asset ID on our storage account
     * `stickers` A string containing the stickers applied to this item, as comma-separated pairs of stickerid,wear
     * `wear` The item's floating-point wear value, between 0 and 1 if applicable. If not applicable or unknown, then null
     * `appid` The item's Steam appID
     * `contextid` The item's Steam context ID
     * `bot_id` The internal OPSkins ID of the bot which is holding this item

## <a name='BuyItems'>BuyItems(`array` saleids, `int` total)</a>

Purchase one or more items and deliver them to your OPSkins inventory. Once purchased, the item(s) can be delivered to your Steam inventory using [IInventory/Withdraw](#Withdraw). To prevent bot sniping, this endpoint will only purchase listings which have been publicly visible for at least ten minutes, and are not currently limited to Buyers Club members.

If this request succeeds, then it will contain a root-level `balance` property containing your new account balance after the purchase, in USD cents.

Input:

 * `saleids` An array of sale IDs for the items you wish to purchase. 300 maximum.
 * `total` The total cost of these items, in USD cents. For example, if you are purchasing a $2 item and a $1.23 item, then this should be 323. The request will fail if this does not match the actual total.

Output:

 * `items` An array of objects for the items you purchased. Each object has these properties:
     * `saleid` The OPSkins sale ID of the item. This will be one of the IDs you passed in your request.
     * `new_itemid` The new OPSkins ID of the item in your OPSkins inventory. This is the ID you will pass to Withdraw in order to withdraw the item to your Steam inventory. This will become the item's sale ID if you choose to re-list it.
     * `name` The name of the item
     * `bot_id` The internal OPSkins ID of the bot which is holding this item
